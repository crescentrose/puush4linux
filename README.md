# puush4linux

puush4linux is a Linux client for the popular screenshot host [puush](http://puush.me). puush4linux aims to reach feature parity with the official Windows puush client. It currently supports authentication, taking screenshots and file uploading.

## Installation

**Arch Linux** users may install the [puush4linux package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/puush4linux/) from the AUR, packaged by [/u/some_random_guy_5345](https://www.reddit.com/user/some_random_guy_5345).

1. Install dependencies: `bash`, `scrot`, `curl`, and `xclip`; optionally: `libnotify` and `optipng`.
2. Download the puush file and copy it to `/usr/bin`.
3. Run `puush -l` in your terminal and enter your user name and password to log in.
4. Set up shortcuts in your window manager/desktop environment to your liking.
 Example (XFCE):

## Usage

`puush <options> [filename]`

You do not need to specify the file name if you are going to use the script to take a screenshot.

### Options

`-q` - Don't show any notifications on the desktop. (Notifications are automatically disabled if libnotify isn't found on the system.)

`-c` - Copy the URL of the uploaded file to X clipboard. If this is not specified, the URL will be sent to stdout.

`-h` - Display help.

`-a` - Take a screenshot of an area and then upload it.

`-f` - Take a screenshot of the entire screen and upload it.

`-w` - Take a screenshot of the active window and upload it.

`-l` - (Re-)log in to puush with your username and password.

`-b` - Don't optimize images with optipng; only applies when using `-afw` (Automatically disabled if optipng isn't found on the system)

### Examples

`puush -c -a` - Take a screenshot of an area, upload it and put the link into the clipboard. (Equivalent to Ctrl+Shift+4 on Windows systems.)

`puush -q myfile.png` - Upload an image and print the uploaded file URL to stdout without displaying desktop notifications.
